### Wireframes

Wireframes are used in the design process to create a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of the website. They help in planning the layout and structure of the website, ensuring that all elements are placed logically and efficiently. Wireframes are essential for identifying potential usability issues early in the design process and for communicating the design vision to stakeholders.

Below are my wireframes design of home page for different screen sizes:


#### Laptop

The wireframe for the laptop version of the homepage is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the website's features and content. It includes a navigation bar at the top, a large hero image, and sections for sessions, tips and support.
